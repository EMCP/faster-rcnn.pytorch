# An Updated *Faster* Pytorch Implementation of Faster R-CNN

## Introduction


This project is based on a *faster* pytorch implementation of faster R-CNN, which needed updating.  

* [jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch), developed based on PyTorch v0.4.0 and v1.0

During our implementing, we referred the above implementation. However, our implementation has several unique and new features compared with the above implementation:

### What I am going to do

* Drop Python v2.7.x support (Deprecated in 2020)
* Add Pytorch v1.3.x support
* Migrate to torchvision based ResNet 101, instead of the original implementation

## Preparation


First of all, clone the code
```
git clone https://github.com/emcp/faster-rcnn.pytorch.git
```

Then, create a folder:
```
cd faster-rcnn.pytorch && mkdir data
```

### prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* Pytorch 1.3+
* CUDA 10.0 or higher

### Data Preparation

* **PASCAL_VOC 07+12**: Please follow the instructions in [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn#beyond-the-demo-installation-for-training-and-testing-models) to prepare VOC datasets. Actually, you can refer to any others. After downloading the data, creat softlinks in the folder data/.

* **COCO**: Please also follow the instructions in [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn#beyond-the-demo-installation-for-training-and-testing-models) to prepare the data.

* **Visual Genome**: Please follow the instructions in [bottom-up-attention](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) to prepare Visual Genome dataset. You need to download the images and object annotation files first, and then perform proprecessing to obtain the vocabulary and cleansed annotations based on the scripts provided in this repository.

### Pretrained Model

**If you want to use pytorch pre-trained models, please remember to transpose images from BGR to RGB, and also use the same data transformer (minus mean and normalize) as used in pretrained model.**

### Compilation

Install all the python dependencies using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Compile the cuda dependencies using following simple commands:

```
cd lib
python setup.py build develop
```

It will compile all the modules you need, including NMS, ROI_Pooing, ROI_Align and ROI_Crop.


## Train

Before training, set the right directory to save and load the trained models. Change the arguments "save_dir" and "load_dir" in trainval_net.py and test_net.py to adapt to your environment.

To train a faster R-CNN model with vgg16 on pascal_voc, simply run:
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU_ID python trainval_net.py \
                   --dataset pascal_voc --net vgg16 \
                   --bs $BATCH_SIZE --nw $WORKER_NUMBER \
                   --lr $LEARNING_RATE --lr_decay_step $DECAY_STEP \
                   --cuda
```
where 'bs' is the batch size with default 1. Alternatively, to train with resnet101 on pascal_voc, simple run:
```
 CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU_ID python trainval_net.py \
                    --dataset pascal_voc --net res101 \
                    --bs $BATCH_SIZE --nw $WORKER_NUMBER \
                    --lr $LEARNING_RATE --lr_decay_step $DECAY_STEP \
                    --cuda
```
Above, BATCH_SIZE and WORKER_NUMBER can be set adaptively according to your GPU memory size. **On Titan Xp with 12G memory, it can be up to 4**.

If you have multiple (say 8) Titan Xp GPUs, then just use them all! Try:
```
python trainval_net.py --dataset pascal_voc --net vgg16 \
                       --bs 24 --nw 8 \
                       --lr $LEARNING_RATE --lr_decay_step $DECAY_STEP \
                       --cuda --mGPUs

```

Change dataset to "coco" or 'vg' if you want to train on COCO or Visual Genome.

## Test

If you want to evaluate the detection performance of a pre-trained vgg16 model on pascal_voc test set, simply run
```
python test_net.py --dataset pascal_voc --net vgg16 \
                   --checksession $SESSION --checkepoch $EPOCH --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT \
                   --cuda
```
Specify the specific model session, check epoch and checkpoint, e.g., SESSION=1, EPOCH=6, CHECKPOINT=416.

## Demo

If you want to run detection on your own images with a pre-trained model, download the pretrained model listed in above tables or train your own models at first, then add images to folder $ROOT/images, and then run
```
python demo.py --net vgg16 \
               --checksession $SESSION --checkepoch $EPOCH --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT \
               --cuda --load_dir path/to/model/directoy
```

Then you will find the detection results in folder $ROOT/images.

**Note the default demo.py merely support pascal_voc categories. You need to change the [line](https://github.com/jwyang/faster-rcnn.pytorch/blob/530f3fdccaa60d05fa068bc2148695211586bd88/demo.py#L156) to adapt your own model.**

Below are some detection results:

<div style="color:#0000FF" align="center">
<img src="images/img3_det_res101.jpg" width="430"/> <img src="images/img4_det_res101.jpg" width="430"/>
</div>

## Webcam Demo

You can use a webcam in a real-time demo by running
```
python demo.py --net vgg16 \
               --checksession $SESSION --checkepoch $EPOCH --checkpoint $CHECKPOINT \
               --cuda --load_dir path/to/model/directoy \
               --webcam $WEBCAM_ID
```
The demo is stopped by clicking the image window and then pressing the 'q' key.
